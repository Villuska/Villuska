- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Villuska

I'm currently studying Information technology at Aalto University

I'm also interested in Computer Science and Data Science. I'm using GitHub for my personal and some of my University projects.

Most of my private projects revolve around esports data analytics and are kept private due to their use in the sports betting industry.
